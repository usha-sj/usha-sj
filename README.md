## About

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Hey, I’m **Usha** 👋  
> I’m a Computer Science Specialist and Math minor at UofT focused on building intelligent systems at the intersection of AI and full-stack engineering.  
>  
> I recently wrapped up an exchange semester at the University of Helsinki 🇫🇮 and am currently building scalable software across ML, backend architecture, and fintech applications.

### Experience Highlights

**LLM Engineer (OurPATHS – CSC392 UofT Real-World AI/ML System Solutions)**  
• Designed and built the dashboard UI in React, implementing core pages and user flows  
• Engineered an end-to-end agentic RAG pipeline (intent classification → service invocation → GPT-4 formatting) powering the chatbot  
• Scraped and processed 800+ HTA documents on Niagara HPC, generating 10K+ embeddings stored in Azure Blob and a vector database  
• Integrated stakeholder feedback from 8+ senior HTA professionals across 3 pharmaceutical companies (Sanofi, Takeda, Pfizer) with final pitch to Sanofi 

**Software Engineering Intern (ParkUsher)**  
• Designed and implemented tailored Premium and Free user flows, resolving Profile UX friction through competitor benchmarking and user feedback analysis  
• Built and deployed a new React frontend to 22K+ users, collaborating in agile sprints with design and marketing teams  

I enjoy working across the full stack: from backend architecture and model integration to clean, intuitive frontend experiences.

Currently seeking SWE and PM roles for Summer 2026.
